We do not know how to read or write to the PLC using digital values. This is what is causing dilemmas and the lab handout from 
West explains most of the process fairly well. As far as the input to control an input in procedure 1 we think you are to control the input to the ProSense transmiter that then feeds into the analog card. Chapter 3-5 of the DL-05 manual are most likely to be helpful.
